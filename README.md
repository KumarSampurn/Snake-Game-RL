# Snake Game with Reinforcement Learning using Pygame, PyTorch, and Q-Learning

This project combines the classic Snake game implemented in Pygame with reinforcement learning techniques using PyTorch and the Q-learning algorithm. The goal is to train an AI agent to play the Snake game optimally through reinforcement learning.

## Requirements
- Python 3.11
- Pygame
- PyTorch

## Installation

Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/KumarSampurn/Snake-Game-RL.git
    ```



## Usage

1. Run the main script to start training the reinforcement learning agent:
    ```
    python agent.py
    ```
2. The Snake game window will open, and the agent will start training. You can observe the game and training process in the window.


## Files

- `agent.py`: This script contains the main functionality for training the reinforcement learning agent and fines the reinforcement learning agent using the Q-learning algorithm with PyTorch..
- `game.py`: Implements the Snake game using Pygame.
- `model.py`: Initializes the pytorch model.
